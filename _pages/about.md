I am currently a Senior Data Analyst at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)- based in Singapore, supporting the Sales Cycle Acceleration team's data needs across APJ. I am also a part-time [Master of IT in Business student at Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/), specializing in AI. My research interests lie in the intersection between AI, Systems and Human-Computer Interaction, where I hope to discover how we can make deploy AI systems more seamlessly, and how to design AI applications that are less of a black-box for end-users.   

Beyond work and studies, I am passionate about skills-based volunteering, and have worked extensively with non-profits as part of [Bridges for Enterprise](https://www.bridgesforenterprise.com) and [Thrive Social Consulting](https://thrivesocialsg.com/), where we help them solve varying challenges through software products and consulting engagements respectively. I did my undergraduate in Business Management at SMU, where I realized only in my third year, that I had a deep interest in Computer Science - hence the continued efforts to pivot into this wonderful domain.
